Place your product images here with these filenames to match the homepage:

- product_capsules.png    (e.g. generated-image (5).png)
- product_powder.png      (e.g. generated-image (4).png)

You can copy your images into this folder via the OS. The homepage references these paths:
/static/images/product_capsules.png
/static/images/product_powder.png

If you want, I can embed base64 images into the templates instead, but it's better to keep them as files in /static/images/ for performance and caching.
